      <h1>Excel charts to PowerPoint — automated, repeatable, professional.</h1>
      <p>
        Chart to Deck Manager (CDM) is a Windows desktop reporting tool for analysts, consultants, and operators who need to turn Excel-based charts into clean,
        consistently formatted PowerPoint decks — without manual copy/paste or fragile links.

          <h2>Built for real reporting workflows</h2>
          <p>
            Import one or more Excel workbooks, copy/paste charts into CDM slots, choose your slide size, and export a real PowerPoint deck.
            The key idea: your deck is <em>regenerable</em>. Rebuild the same deck again tomorrow and get the same structure.

          <h2>Layouts that match how people present</h2>
          <p>
            Pick 1‑up, 2‑up, 3‑up, or 4‑up. Two-up supports side-by-side or over/under. Three-up supports single-on-top or single-on-bottom.
            CDM keeps the layout rules consistent across slides and across rebuilds.

          <h2>Exports a standard PPTX you can open and share</h2>
          <p>
            CDM generates a standard .pptx file that opens directly in PowerPoint. The output deck is yours — editable, shareable, and suitable for
            client delivery or internal reporting.

          <p>
            CDM includes a 30‑day free trial. After the trial, purchase a one‑time license and activate locally with a single license key.
            No accounts. No servers.

      <div class="instructions">
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Import and Add File(s) Imports charts from one or more Excel workbooks and PowerPoint Presentations and adds them in image format to the current deck.</p>
<ul><li>Hidden Excel worksheets and PowerPoint Slides are not imported.</li></ul>
<h3>Step 2. Replace Existing Slides (Clears Deck)</h3>
<p>Check box appears when at least one slide exists and will clear all slides in the current deck before importing new charts.</p>
<h3>Step 3. Select Slide Size</h3>
<p>Select Widescreen (16:9) or Standard (4:3) for the entire presentation.</p>
<h3>Step 4. Arranging Charts</h3>
<p>Slides start as 1-Up. Adding a second chart creates a 2-Up slide; a third chart creates a 3-Up slide, and a 4th chart creates a 4- Up slide. Charts always maintain their original aspect ratios and are never distorted.</p>
<p>2-up slides may be arranged side by side or over/under 3 up slides may be arranged with a single chart on top or on the bottom. Trying to move a 5th chart to a 4-up Slide swaps the charts between the 4-up and source slides.  Whilst trying to paste a 5th chart to a 4-up slide places the pasted chart to a new slide below the 4-up Slide.</p>
<ul><li>Moving charts within or between slides will result in charts swapping positions.</li></ul>
<h3>Step 5. Reordering Slides</h3>
<p>Grab handles in the bottom left corner of each slide enables dragging a slide up or down to insert between others.</p>
<p>Sliding the divider separating the left and right panes allows the user to zoom in/out and makes arranging slides easier.</p>
<h3>Step 6. Clipboard & Edit Controls</h3>
<p>These controls operate on the currently selected chart.</p>
<p>Copy — copies the selected slide, Ctrl-C is also supported to copy content outside of CDM. Paste — inserts the copied chart or clipboard content into the selected slide or the area before or after an existing slide. Ctrl-V is also supported to paste content inside or outside of CDM.</p>
<ul><li>Delete Slide — deletes the selected slide. Delete key is also supported for this action.</li><li>Undo — reverts the most recent actions one at a time (doesn’t undo import or cleared deck actions). Ctrl-Z is also</li></ul>
<p>supported.</p>
<h3>Step 7. Export Slide to PowerPoint</h3>
<p>Export only the currently selected slide to a new PowerPoint file.</p>
<h3>Step 8. Choose Export Folder</h3>
<p>Select the folder where exported PowerPoint files will be saved. Export folder defaults to the source file(s) location. Click Change Export Folder to select a different destination.</p>
<h3>Step 9. Save PowerPoint As</h3>
<p>Enter the filename in Save PowerPoint As Field; Existing filenames auto-increment if a new filename is not entered.</p>
<h3>Step 10. Export Deck to PowerPoint</h3>
<p>Export the entire deck exactly as shown in the right pane. PowerPoint opens automatically.</p>
